    <h1>Notes</h1>

    <h2>P2: Event</h2>

    <p>
        <b>Idea 1: Recipe Building, Website</b>
            <br><i>An invitation is sent to those who submitted an ingredient to participate in recipe building on the website.</i> Using PHP, the recipes would be automatically uploaded to the website as they are submitted. Everyone who submits a recipe is given a physical cookbook one compiled. 
            <br>
            <br> +++ Can span a few days, everyone can submit on their own time
            <br> --- Not a communal event, gathering / posting images will be hard
            <br> ??? Ability to see / use submissions as they come
</ul>

    <p>
       <b> Idea 2: Recipe Building, E-mail </b>
            <br><i>An invitation is sent to those who submitted an ingredient to e-mail back a recipe.</i> Everyone who submits a recipe is given a physical cookbook one compiled.
            <br>
            <br> +++ Can span a few days, everyone can submit on their own time, can e-mail pictures easily 
            <br> --- Not a communal event, can't see what's been submitted
            <br> ??? Anonymous until the book comes out, maybe the surprise is nice, chance of similar or duplicate recipes, how two people make the same dish
<br>

    </p>

        <p>
        <b>Idea 3: Recipe Building, Virtual Event </b>
            <br><i>An invitation is sent to join a Zoom.</i> Together, we talk informally about the ingredients, and people talk about recipes they'd make, everyone typing them into the chat.Everyone who submits a recipe is given a physical cookbook one compiled.
            <br>
            <br> +++ Adds a face to a name, ingredient; more commual, social, communicative
            <br> --- Time zones, scheduling, high chance of low-attendance, Zoom fatigue
            <br> ??? Live event has possibility for chance
    <p>
        <b>QUESTIONS</b> 
            <ul><li> How to translate / highlight the fact that the ingredients were <i>gathered,</i> in both the receipe and cookbook. What does indexing this look like? Ordering? Most used ingredient? 
            <li> What do I ask of the recipes? Should it have a personal angle? A community angle? A memory attached? 
            <li> Are images important?
            <li> Is recipe building even the "event"???? Cookbook launch / potluck instead?
